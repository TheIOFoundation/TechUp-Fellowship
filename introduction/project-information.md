# Project Information

## About

Under the TechUp initiative, the Tech Up Fellowship, is a project by The IO Foundation designed to equip technologists with a solid understanding of the Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) ecosystem. Participants acquire the necessary skills to engage in the development of digital standards and policies, ensuring that technology prioritizes protecting users by design through the observance of the Data-Centric Digital Rights framework.

The fellowship encourages collaboration and provides opportunities for active participation in SDO work and activities.
